Thrust

I started to code Thrust for MSDOG but later I had a revelation so now it is
converted to GGI, X11 and a counple of other backends.

This is the game from the C64 and BBC Micro that you cannot live without.

See the file INSTALL for building and installation instructions.

There is a web page that is supposed to be up to date. You can find it at
http://www.lysator.liu.se/~peda/thrust/, and it should contain information
about the latest developement. It also contains information to help you build
your own levels.

Thrust is free software. See the file COPYING for copying conditions.
