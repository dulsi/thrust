Inertia Blast

In Inertia Blast, you control a ship attempting to steal energy pods to help
the rebellion. A tractor beam lifts the energy pod but it's weight makes the
ship harder to control. Watch out for the defense systems. Good luck.

Inertia Blast is a clone of Thrust from the C64 and BBC Micro. Peter Ekberg
created this version for MSDOS but later ported it to other systems. All of
those other systems have been removed from this version in favor of SDL.

Installing

cmake . && make && sudo make install
