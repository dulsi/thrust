Version 0.92 September 6, 2021

* Minor fixes for rpm build

Version 0.91 September 5, 2021

* Minor fixes for rpm build

Version 0.90 September 5, 2021

* Rename the project to Inertia Blast.

* Add SDL support

* Remove GGI, svgalib, X11, and DirectX support.

* Replace images for shield, ship, power plant, and fuel.

* Replace title screen and story text.

* Add Gamerzilla trophies.

* Switch to cmake.

Version 0.89f January 29, 2006

* Make sure src/compat.h finds lib/getopt.h.

* Make sure lib/getopt.h is distributed. Went missing in the automake
  conversion in 0.89d.

* Readd -lm link option. Went missing in the automake conversion in 0.89d.

* Really fix VPATH build of Windows resources (datasrc/thrust_rc.rc).

* Fix various VPATH issues in maintainer-mode.


Version 0.89e January 5, 2006

* Fix VPATH build of Windows resources (datasrc/thrust_rc.rc).

* Fix MIT shared memory compile time detection for X11 backend. I.e. properly
  #define MITSHM when shared memory has been detected.

* xthrust should not be linked with the windows resources, noted by
  Christoph Egger.

* Fix src/silence.c to match the rename of thrust.snd to engine.snd, noted
  by Christoph Egger.

* Don't require malloc.h, noted by Christoph Egger.

* Put missing library function in a library that is linked with all
  applications, if any needed library functions are missing.

* Handle missing netpbm-config script.


Version 0.89d January 4, 2006

* The 'thrust' binary is using the new GGI backend, the SVGAlib version has
  been renamed to 'svgathrust'.

* The binary distribution has been discontinued.

* Don't specify the exact high score file in the man page. This moves the
  pod2man dependency to maintainer-mode.

* Rewrite of helpers bin2c, txt2c and reverse in awk, which should eliminate
  at least some cross compiling issues. However, it is possible that GNU awk
  is required. This only affects maintainer-mode, so it is not a big issue.

* Rename datasrc/thrustrc.rc to datasrc/thrust_rc.rc and datasrc/thrust.snd to
  datasrc/engine.snd.

* Look for netpbm and prefer it over plain old pbm for building the ppm2c
  helper.

* Using Automake and Autoheader instead of hand crafted files. GNU make
  specific constructs have been removed from the build system, which should
  remove the GNU make requirement.

* Windows port is built with MinGW and MSYS. It is also possible to build with
  Cygwin, but there seems to be some X11 problem in the keyboard area, and
  colors in the X11 version are only displayed if the Cygwin X server runs in
  fullscreen mode. The Visual Studio project file has been discontinued.

* Abstracted away soundIt behind a thin layer, facilitating an alternative
  sound implementation using DirectSound for the MinGW port. Also provide a
  silent sound implementation so that the other source files are not aware of
  the presence of a functional sound subsystem.

* Adapted SoundIt so that sound works on Cygwin, albeit with a bit of delay.

* A new helper program 'skip' is included, eliminating the need to use 'dd'
  during build. All bmp-files have been revised to not include 0x0a and 0x1a
  as these may cause build problems on Windows.

* The shield is flashing when it is active and the tractor beams are flashing
  when fuel is picked up.

* Not possible to shoot with the shield active. The visible diameter of the
  shield is one pixel larger.

* Made the Pod graphically larger and physically heavier and the Pod pidestal
  is included. Changed the dynamics of picking up the Pod.

* Correct center of mass when the ship and the Pod are connected. The ship and
  the Pod are also further from each other when they are connected.

* Guns fire more, and they fire more and more as the game progresses. The
  shots from the Guns are slightly slower. The Guns do not fire at other
  installations.

* The color of the Guns are varied on the different levels.

* The teleport bars are slightly wider.

* The Power Plant is flashing and there is a warning sound as it counts down
  in it's critical phase.

* One life is lost if the planet is destroyed and the player hasn't escaped.
  The screen is flashed as the planet is destroyed.

* Possible to play on with zero spare lives, effectively giving the player one
  extra life.

* Requires autoconf 2.5x and configure.in has been renamed to configure.ac.

* Keyboard configuration changes are saved in .thrustrc.


Version 0.89c September 30, 2001

* Fixed an escape sequence bug in the man page source.

* Fixed the description of the .thrustrc file in the man page to use a list.

* Silenced a couple of warnings.

* Changed the Makefile so that all .c files in datasrc/ are really prebuilt
  and also fixed it so that the prebuilt versions are used when building. This
  should specifically remove the build dependency on the netpbm package.

* Fixed the thrust.html ducumentation target.

* Updated the previously forgotten email instance of Joey Hess.


Version 0.89b September 19, 2001

* Merge from Debian package: Handle dummy SVGAlib failure gracefully.

* Merge from Debian package: Include description of the .thrustrc file in the
  man page originally contributed by Jonathan Eisenstein.

* Merge from Debian package: Joey Hess changed his email address *again*. ;-)

* Updated config.guess and config.sub.


Version 0.89a September 16, 2001

* Dag Asheim tripped on a bug when he designed a level. Sliders were not
  correctly connected to buttons when multiple sets of buttons existed.

* The configure script failed to detect vga_getmodenumber in SVGAlib even
  if it was present.

* Cosmetic bug fixed in level6.def.


Version 0.89  August 18, 1998

* Thrust is now behaving better with respect to the laws of physics. It
  is the case when the ship and the blob are connected that has been
  updated. It should now be correct. I used the following passage from
  a physics text book as guidance:

  "The center of mass of a system of particles moves as if it were a
   particle of mass equal to the total mass of the system and subject
   to the external force applied to the system."

  Thanks to all the people (Mark Carroll, Timo Korvola, etc) who has mentioned
  the strangeness of loss of thrust when the ship and the blob are swinging all
  over the place.

* The ground is made visible when the shield is activated. Applicable to
  rounds where the ground is invisible. Thanks to Tim Waugh for pointing this
  out.

* Levels are incremented instead of reset to one when a new stage is
  entered.

* Port for Windows available. Bound to be buggy. Uses DirectX 3.0 which means
  that it runs on NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 and on Windows 95/98.

* All .c files in datasrc/ are prebuilt in the source distribution.

* MSDOG version discontinued.

* Detection of the pbm library is now successful on systems where the library
  does not need any additional include/library dirs.

* The thrust sound wasn't silenced properly if quiting while thrusting. Thanks
  to Jan Djärv, who pointed this out.


Version 0.83c April 7, 1997

* Stupid me. You should only get 1000 units on fuel, not 5000.


Version 0.83b April 3, 1997

* A bug in the code that verifies that the level descriptions are correct
  caused a rejection of the first level. Thanks to Joey Hess who pointed this
  out. Shame on me for not testing prior to the release.


Version 0.83a April 1, 1997

* A restart point in level 6 caused unconditional death. Not so good, but now
  it's fixed. Thanks to Jan Djärv, who pointed this out.

* An icon (32x32) for Windows included. Thanx bro.


Version 0.83  March 21, 1997

* If two shots arrive at the same target at the same time, only that target is
  destroyed, not the target closest to the real target as well.

* Lowercase characters in the font.

* Cosmetic improvments. The amount of fuel left and the score is drawn in a box
  similar to the one in the original. The animation area was moved to the lower
  part of the screen, making room for the new box at the top of the screen. The
  ship appears more smooth when rotated. X11 icon included, it is not just a
  noisy square anymore.

* X11 demo is only run if the window has focus.

* X11 keyboard handling is better, still not handling Compose though.

* The option --step which makes Thrust skip the drawing of two out of three
  frames and the option --double which draws Thrust in a bigger X window.
  However, --double is incredibly slow.

* Instructions include the silly background story; supplied by Wolfram Kleff
  over a year ago.

* The Power Plant is not destoyed until the countdown is ended. When the count-
  down ends, all objects explode. Do that in level five for maximum on screen
  explosive effect (10 objects simultaneously exploding, if you have the Pod).

* In the SVGAlib version, the names of the keys are pulled out of the kernel in
  the same way as the utility "dumpkeys" is doing this. As a consequence, some
  keys have changed their names, so you might have to edit your .thrustrc file.

* Thrust runs on MSDOG. Indrek Mandre pointed me in the direction of DJGPP and
  a port of SVGAlib which made it a rather easy task, but I still really really
  detest MSDOG.


Version 0.79c February 25, 1997

* The "About"-code segfaulted, and so did the gamma correction option handling
  in some cases. Both are fixed.


Version 0.79b February 22, 1997

* Sound wasn't working. Another silly play_sound=0; assignment.


Version 0.79a February 21, 1997

* Sound wasn't working. Silly play_sound=0; statement removed.


Version 0.79  February 20, 1997

* Changed the interaction between the ship and the blob when they are connected
  and the ship is accelerated. The new behaviour is more correct and more like
  the original.

* Sound added to the Linux version. Uses the SoundIt library written by Brad
  Pitzel (pitzel@cs.sfu.ca). Sound was added to thrust by Maik Roeder.
  In addition, SoundIt has been adapted so that sound works for Solaris,
  SunOS and HP-UX as well, but only if the sound device supports linear
  encoding.

* Configurable keys. Configuration is stored in ${HOME}/.thrustrc which is read
  at startup. See the included file "thrustrc" for an example of how .thrustrc
  can be written.

* X version understand the -display and -geometry options.

* Support for X-servers not capable of MIT shared memory.

* Added an option --gamma with which you can change the brightness of the
  colors.

* New rules applies for advancement to the next level. Also, there is a maximum
  altitude.

* 750 points (instead of 700) are given when the bunkers are shot down.

* Messages between the levels and a game over message.

* Portability changes. The X version now builds on Linux, Ultrix 4.5, OSF1 4.0,
  OpenBSD 2.0, Solaris 2.4/2.5, HP-UX 10.20, Irix 4.0.5, AIX 4.2 and SunOS 4.1.
  Very likely a whole bunch of others. Fix for OpenBSD by Kenneth Stailey, the
  rest by myself.


Version 0.73  January 14, 1997

* Added syncronization for fast systems. The X version was way too fast for
  some systems.


Version 0.71  January 13, 1997

* Preliminary X11 support. Only works with servers capable of MIT shared memory
  and limited to visuals with 8 bits per pixel pseudocolor.

* Compatibility changes and the use of GNU autoconf makes it possible to run
  the game on Solaris 2.5. With some luck, it works for other unices as well.

* The fired shots can destroy targets even when the hit is not on the screen.

* Fixed the door used in level 6.

* Made the mass of the blob configurable (REL_MASS in src/thrust.h). The mass
  of the blob is given in relation to the mass of the ship. The value is also
  changed from the previous 1.0 to 0.8 in responce to some requests.

* Updated man page. Most of the needed information is in there.

* Some memory allocation misfeatures corrected by Maik Roeder.

* Fixed the makefile. It didn't work if you didn't have the directory where the
  binary was supposed to be installed.
  Thanks go to Martin Wickman who pointed this out.

* Removed the bindist target from the Makefile in the binary distribution.

* Enabled the use of svga modes larger than 320x200. The game is simply drawn
  in a small area of the larger screen. Option --svgamode added. I've been able
  to play in 640x480, 800x600 and 1024x768.
  Start with 'thrust -s G640x480x256'. 320x200 is still the default.


Version 0.67  December 22, 1996

* Fixed the nasty little bug which caused some "unexplainable" deaths. It must
  have been there for ages, but hasn't triggered prior to v0.61.

* Level 6 included. Pictures supplied by Christian Janoff. The door is still in
  need of some work as you will notice when you get there. The level is
  playable though.

* Fixed a small cosmetic bug in level 5.

* Joey Hess changed his email address *again*. ;-)


Version 0.61  December 19, 1996

* Level 5 included. Pictures supplied by Christian Janoff.

* New and improved title picture. Supplied by Christian Janoff.


Version 0.59  December 11, 1995

* Configurable keys.

* The guns are silent for a while when the plant has been hit. Thanks go to
  Wolfram Kleff since he pointed out this behaviour.

* Fixed a small bug with the teleport bars.

* Responds to the arguments -v, --version, -h and --help.

* Changed the internal representation of the definitions of the levels to make
  it easier to enter the block codes (was ½ and others, now normal ASCII).

* A breif description of how to make your own level.

* Man page, maintained by Joey Hess (joey@kitenet.net).

* Binary version compiled ELF, not a.out.


Version 0.53  November 6, 1995

* ELF-problem fixed. Thanks go to Mirko Streckenbach. Now it should compile on
  ELF systems as well.

* The game enters a demo mode if not touched.

* The teleport bars at the end of a completed level.

* The game is now not as quick as it was before, making it easier.


Version 0.47

* Can't remember. That's why I'm starting this list.


Version 0.41

* The first version released for Linux and SVGAlib. Before this, the versions
  wasn't numbered.

___

The first version got on the way when I discovered that my new fancy computer
was able to update the whole screen in every retrace of the monitor. This must
have been in 1993 or 1994 with my 486DX50. Not a very efficient way of
scrolling, but this is still how it works.
